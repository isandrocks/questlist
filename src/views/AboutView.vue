    <h3 class="self-center"><span class="text-[--isr-c-red]">Con-Save</span> is a abbraviated D&D term for either constitution saving throw or concentration saving throw depending on who you are playing with. I use it for constitution saving throw if you were wondering.</h3>
    <h3 class="self-center">"A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying to invade your mind. You don’t normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your character or a monster (if you’re the DM) is at risk. A save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it." - DnD Beyond</h3>
    <h3 class="self-center">A <span class="text-[--isr-c-red]">Con-Save</span> is used to endure a toxic hazard.</h3>
